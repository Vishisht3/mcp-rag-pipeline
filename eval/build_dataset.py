eval/build_dataset.py
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Curates and validates the evaluation dataset.

Two modes:
  1. SEED  — writes the hand-crafted baseline dataset (60 QA pairs) to
             eval/dataset.jsonl.  Run once to bootstrap.
  2. GENERATE — uses the LLM to auto-generate additional QA pairs from
                your ingested documents, then appends them.

Dataset schema (one JSON object per line):
{
  "id":           "q001",          # stable unique ID
  "question":     "...",           # natural-language question
  "ground_truth": "...",           # reference answer (used for context recall)
  "source_docs":  ["doc_a.txt"],   # which documents should be retrieved
  "difficulty":   "easy|medium|hard",
  "category":     "factual|reasoning|multi-hop|edge-case"
}

Usage:
  python eval/build_dataset.py --mode seed
  python eval/build_dataset.py --mode generate --n 40 --config config/phase3.yaml
